            <h2>About Health Code Violations</h2>
            <p>If a restaurant is given a health code violation, the restaurant on this database on NYC Open Data receives three important factors: <b>Violation Code</b>, <b>Violation Description</b>, and <b>Crtical Flag</b>. The Violation Code organizes the violation in a numerical sense, the Violation Description describes the found violations in a restaurants and the Critical Flag determines if the violation is critical or not critical. The New York Department of Health and Mental Hygiene describes critical violations as one that can most likely cause food borne illnesses.</p>

            <h2>Narrowed Down </h2>
            <p>For this website, I decided to narrow it down to only the critical violation. Furthemore, I will only show the critical violations in restaurants that happened in the last month from February 28, 2023 to March 28, 2023 near the Washington Square Park area. I did notice that I left out some zipcodes around the park but I'll continue to add on to this website!</p>
