          <p>This website is a website I have been thinking about making for a pretty long time. There are still some creative and technical aspects like NYC's API that I want to incorporate. Although this isn't an academic topic, I thought it would be relevant to everyone that could possibly access this website. This website will show the restaurants that have committed a critical health code violation near NYU and Washington Square Park. I decided to focus on the zipcode 10012 but there is always room for more zip codes. I was inspired to make this website after coming across a <a href="https://nypost.com/2023/03/17/rat-soup-shuts-down-nycs-popular-gammeeok-restaurant/"> New York Post</a> about a clear health code violation. I have been to this restaurant so many times. It used to be one of my favorite restaurants because my mother and I went all the time. After finding out about this violation, I felt kind of betrayed because I loved going to this restaurant. Obviously, not all restaurants are going to be 100% clean and not all restaurants are going to follow all rules set by the Department of Health and Mental Hygiene.</p>

          <h2>Side Note</h2>
          <p>Also I believe it is important to note that this website should not deter you from going to the restaurants around Washington Square Park again. It is up to you to decide. Plus, restaurants do recover from health code violations. It is important to remind oneself that health code violations can happen to any restaurant no matter the type of restaurant it is. It is also important to remind oneself that even though a restaurant might have gotten a health code violation, it 100% does not mean that the restaurant is not hygienic. Most importantly, the reason I wanted to make this website was to increase one's awareness about health code violations in restaurants around WSP by making a more readable website. For example, if you go onto the NYC Open Data website, I found that the information about restaurant health code violations is hard to get to. I felt that it could be easier to drill down to and for NYU students to access. This information is open to view by anyone in <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/DOHMH-New-York-City-Restaurant-Inspection-Results/43nn-pn8j"> New York City Open Data</a>. Anyways, I wanted everyone to read this side note before accessing the rest of the website. To access it, please click on the rat on the left hand side of this website. Also, on the NYC Open Data website, it states that some of the information may be incorrect or outdated and I felt that I should reiterate it. </p>
