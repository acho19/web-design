          <p>Welcome to Alice Cho's resume. I wanted this website to be aesthetically simple as possible because I want to be able to keep on adding things to this website without having to completely change the format. As time goes on, I want to keep on adding to this website while fixing it up. First and foremost, I want to acquire a domain name and start paying for a hosting service but wow they are expensive. Regardless, I am extremely happy to have a starting point for my resume website. This initial page is just a simple page for this paragraph that you are reading but the real resume and how I want to format my future website is accessible by clicking on the <a href = "experience.html">my experience</a> part here or in the navigation bar/menu. For the user interface of my resume website, I wanted to incorporate a graphical user interface because it is simply relevant. The content "folder" of my resume is a table and/or image. Also on the contact folder, I decided to use Formspree because Professor Clayton mentioned how useful it is in class. I am hoping that this website continues to keep a simple style so that potential recruiters can have an easy time accessing my experiences. Please click on either my beautiful face or the navigating header to access my resume.</p>
